Automated Sequence Assembly System for Whole Exome Sequencing

The primary purpose of this pipeline is to efficiently manage the sequence assembly process for WES data. Traditional manual sequence assembly methods are often time-consuming and labor-intensive, requiring extensive manual intervention and attention to detail. This automated pipeline addresses these challenges by providing a cohesive system that integrates multiple bioinformatics tools and processes, facilitating a smooth and accurate assembly of sequences. It allows users to input raw sequencing data and proceed through quality control, alignment, variant calling, and annotation with minimal manual intervention, ultimately saving valuable time and resources.
